Hyphenated words like <code>font-size</code> are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.\nAll property value length units (like <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>fontSize</code>) are assumed to be in <code>px</code> unless otherwise specified.

First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology. React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app. Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.\nAlthough React components can manage their own state locally, when you have a complex app, it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, you need to use the <code>react-redux</code> package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux <code>state</code> and <code>dispatch</code> to your React components as <code>props</code>.\nOver the next few challenges, first, you'll create a simple React component which allows you to input new text messages. These are added to an array that's displayed in the view. This should be a nice review of what you learned in the React lessons. Next, you'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array. Finally, you'll use <code>react-redux</code> to connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.\n"},

It's similar in structure to the <code>mapStateToProps()</code> function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component <code>props</code>. However, instead of returning a piece of <code>state</code>, each property returns a function that calls <code>dispatch</code> with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this <code>dispatch</code> because it's passed in to <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code> as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed <code>state</code> to <code>mapStateToProps()</code>. Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's <code>store.dispatch()</code> to conduct these dispatches with <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code>. This is similar to how it uses <code>store.subscribe()</code> for components that are mapped to <code>state</code>.\nFor example, you have a <code>loginUser()</code> action creator that takes a <code>username</code> as an action payload. The object returned from <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code> for this action creator would look something like:\n<blockquote>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;submitLoginUser: function(username) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispatch(loginUser(username));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</blockquote>\n"},

The code should look similar, except for the use of <code>import</code> statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges).

Another challenge covers <code>connect</code>. The <code>Provider</code> is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux <code>store</code> and <code>dispatch</code> functions throughout your component tree. <code>Provider</code> takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the <code>Provider</code> for an App component might look like this:\n<blockquote>&lt;Provider store={store}&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;App/&gt;<br>&lt;/Provider&gt;</blockquote>\n"},

There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access <code>this</code>.\nOne common way is to explicitly bind <code>this</code> in the constructor so <code>this</code> becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used <code>this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)</code> for its <code>handleClick</code> method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like <code>this.setState()</code> within your class method, <code>this</code> refers to the class and will not be <code>undefined</code>.\n<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The <code>this</code> keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript but it plays an important role in React.

To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.\nThis paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction.

It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.\nReact uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.\nFor instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: <code>{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }</code>. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.\nHowever, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test in these challenges fail.\nIt's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling <code>ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))</code>.

State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary.

Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.\nThere are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a <em>stateless functional component</em>. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)\nTo create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or <code>null</code>. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:\n<blockquote>// After being transpiled, the &lt;div&gt; will have a CSS class of 'customClass'<br>const DemoComponent = function() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return (<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div className='customClass' /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;);<br>};</blockquote>\nBecause a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page.

This is because <code>class</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses <code>className</code>.\nIn fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase.

React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

You apply a class to your JSX element using the <code>className</code> attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply <strong><em>inline</em></strong> styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.\nYou apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:\n<code>&lt;div style=\"color: yellow; font-size: 16px\"&gt;Mellow Yellow&lt;/div&gt;</code>\nJSX elements use the <code>style</code> attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a <code>string</code>. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript <code>object</code>. Here's an example:\n<code>&lt;div style={{color: \"yellow\", fontSize: 16}}&gt;Mellow Yellow&lt;/div&gt;</code>\nNotice how we camelCase the \"fontSize\" property?

However, there are special instances in HTML called âself-closing tagsâ, or tags that donât require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.\nFor example the line-break tag can be written as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or as <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>, but should never be written as <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code>, since it doesn't contain any content.\nIn JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, on the other hand, can be written as <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.

The method is <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code>, and it takes <code>nextProps</code> and <code>nextState</code> as parameters.\nThis method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new <code>props</code>, even if the <code>props</code> haven't changed. You can use <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> to prevent this by comparing the <code>props</code>. The method must return a <code>boolean</code> value that tells React whether or not to update the component.

Say you have an <code>App</code> component which renders a child component called <code>Welcome</code> that is a stateless functional component. You can pass <code>Welcome</code> a <code>user</code> property by writing:\n<blockquote>&lt;App&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Welcome user='Mark' /&gt;<br>&lt;/App&gt;</blockquote>\nYou use <strong>custom HTML attributes</strong> that React provides support for to pass the property <code>user</code> to the component <code>Welcome</code>.

You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the <code>state</code> important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that <code>state</code>, which are passed in as props.\nFor example, maybe you have an <code>App</code> component that renders a <code>Navbar</code>, among other components. In your <code>App</code>, you have <code>state</code> that contains a lot of user information, but the <code>Navbar</code> only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of <code>state</code> to the <code>Navbar</code> component as a prop.\nThis pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is <em>unidirectional data flow</em>. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.\n"},

In fact, React provides a <code>renderToString()</code> method you can use for this purpose.\nThere are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines.

It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.\nNote that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its <code>state</code>. Its <code>state</code> is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as <code>props</code>.

The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a <code>username</code> in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:\n<blockquote>this.setState({<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;username: 'Lewis'<br>});</blockquote>\nReact expects you to never modify <code>state</code> directly, instead always use <code>this.setState()</code> when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the <code>setState</code> method can be asynchronous.

Instead, remember the first principle of Redux: all app state is held in a single state object in the store. Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux <code>createStore()</code> method.\nIn order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the <code>combineReducers()</code> method. This method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.\nTypically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, in a note-taking app with user authentication, one reducer could handle authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is submitting. For such an application, we might write the <code>combineReducers()</code> method like this:\n<blockquote>const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;auth: authenticationReducer,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;notes: notesReducer<br>});</blockquote>\nNow, the key <code>notes</code> will contain all of the state associated with our notes and handled by our <code>notesReducer</code>.

While the data is optional, actions must carry a <code>type</code> property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.\nThink of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store.

This is the job of a <code>reducer</code> function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A <code>reducer</code> takes <code>state</code> and <code>action</code> as arguments, and it always returns a new <code>state</code>. It is important to see that this is the <strong>only</strong> role of the reducer. It has no side effects &mdash; it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.\nAnother key principle in Redux is that <code>state</code> is read-only. In other words, the <code>reducer</code> function must <strong>always</strong> return a new copy of <code>state</code> and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.\n"},

This immutability, in fact, is what provides such features as time-travel debugging that you may have heard about.\nRedux does not actively enforce state immutability in its store or reducers, that responsibility falls on the programmer. Fortunately, JavaScript (especially ES6) provides several useful tools you can use to enforce the immutability of your state, whether it is a <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>array</code>, or <code>object</code>. Note that strings and numbers are primitive values and are immutable by nature. In other words, 3 is always 3. You cannot change the value of the number 3. An <code>array</code> or <code>object</code>, however, is mutable. In practice, your state will probably consist of an <code>array</code> or <code>object</code>, as these are useful data structures for representing many types of information.\n"},

At some point you'll need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app, so how do you handle these types of requests? Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose, called Redux Thunk middleware. Here's a brief description how to use this with Redux.\nTo include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to <code>Redux.applyMiddleware()</code>. This statement is then provided as a second optional parameter to the <code>createStore()</code> function. Take a look at the code at the bottom of the editor to see this. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in the action creator that takes <code>dispatch</code> as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests.\nIn this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a <code>setTimeout()</code> call. It's common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data, you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is completed.\nRemember that you're passing <code>dispatch</code> as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care of the rest.\n"},

The spread operator has a variety of applications, one of which is well-suited to the previous challenge of producing a new array from an existing array. This is relatively new, but commonly used syntax. For example, if you have an array <code>myArray</code> and write:\n<code>let newArray = [...myArray];</code>\n<code>newArray</code> is now a clone of <code>myArray</code>. Both arrays still exist separately in memory. If you perform a mutation like <code>newArray.push(5)</code>, <code>myArray</code> doesn't change. The <code>...</code> effectively <i>spreads</i> out the values in <code>myArray</code> into a new array. To clone an array but add additional values in the new array, you could write <code>[...myArray, 'new value']</code>. This would return a new array composed of the values in <code>myArray</code> and the string <code>'new value'</code> as the last value. The spread syntax can be used multiple times in array composition like this, but it's important to note that it only makes a shallow copy of the array.
